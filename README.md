# SimsphereInScilab
This is a modernized port of Simsphere model to Scilab 6+
Initially it will be a direct port without all the existing craft + already published code for convolutions.
The purpose is to remove stale or erroneous code and if possible replace obsolete computations with more modern style.

Wherever possible, we will remove hand written code for standard functions with Scilab analogs.

Performance is not a goal, but we will keep an eye on it!

Moreover deadlines are out of the sope of the project for now. It is a hobby project currently.
